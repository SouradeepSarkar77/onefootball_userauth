        <p className='maintext_1'>WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF FOOTBALL</p>


        <p className='subtext_1'>The game has changed - on and off the pitch. A new generation of fans want more: more content, more action, more freedom to relish the game they love on their terms. As the ultimate football platform, our mission is to bring fans closer to football and football closer to fans.</p>
        <p className='subtext_1'>This new fan experience is the best because we work with the best in the business to deliver a mutually beneficial solution. It’s simple: our partners’ content is valuable to fans, our fans are valuable to our partners, who sharpen their content to give our fans even more value and on and on it goes. A virtuous cycle where everybody wins: fans, advertisers, broadcasters, publishers, clubs, leagues, federations and players.</p>

        <p className='maintext_2'>NO ONE GETS YOU CLOSER THAN US</p>
        <p className='subtext_2'>Each month over 100m fans fire up OneFootball for stats, scores, streaming and more. Because unlike the rest of sport, (we’re always reimagining how fans consume football) we’ve taken cues from the entertainment industry to reinvent how Gen Z fans consume football - personalised content, whenever and wherever they want it, and without a subscription.</p>

        <p className='subtext_2'>We have a global network of over 135 Clubs, Federations, Leagues and Players, and that number keeps growing. Why? We turn content partners into business partners.

          Because we are co-owned by some of the world’s biggest clubs and federation, we know what matters to them and design solutions that benefit fans and the most important people in football - the fans.</p>
